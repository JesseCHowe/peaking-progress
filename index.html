            <h1>Peaking Progress</h1>
            <p>The global community has coalesced around the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement, one of which is to peak global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as soon as possible. The longer we delay the peak—the point when global emissions switch from increasing to decreasing—the more difficult it will be to limit global warming. Yet global GHG emissions are still rising and are expected to continue to climb through 2030.</p>
