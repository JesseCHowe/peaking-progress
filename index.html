        <p class="intro-dek">
          The global community has coalesced around the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement, one of which is to peak global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as soon as possible. The longer we delay the peak—the point when global emissions switch from increasing to decreasing—the more difficult it will be to limit global warming. Yet global GHG emissions are still rising and are expected to continue to climb through 2030.

          <p>The timing of when individual countries’ emissions peak and then decline—especially those of major emitters like the United States and China—is critically important in determining whether we can avoid the most dangerous climate impacts.</p>

          <p>19 countries, representing 21 percent of global emissions (based on 1990 emissions data), reached peak emissions in 1990 or earlier. Sixteen of them were former Soviet republics and/or economies in transition. The economic collapse after the breakup of the Soviet Union resulted in several former Soviet republics’ emissions declining sharply. <span data-country="germany" class="highlight">Germany</span> and <span data-country="norway" class="highlight">Norway</span> also peaked by 1990.</p>

          <h3>Peaked in 2000</h3>
          <p>By 2000, 33 countries’ emissions peaked, representing 18 percent of global emissions (based on 2000 emissions data). Many of the countries peaking in the 1990s were European nations such as the <span data-country="united-kingdom" class="highlight">United Kingdom</span>, <span data-country="france" class="highlight">France</span>, the <span data-country="netherlands" class="highlight">Netherlands</span>, <span data-country="belgium" class="highlight">Belgium</span>, <span data-country="denmark" class="highlight">Denmark</span>, <span data-country="sweden" class="highlight">Sweden</span>, <span data-country="switzerland" class="highlight">Switzerland</span> and <span data-country="finland" class="highlight">Finland</span>. <span data-country="costa-rica" class="highlight">Costa Rica</span> also reached peak emissions levels in 1999.</p>

        <div class="step" data-step="2010">
          <h3>Peaked in 2010</h3>
          <p>The number of countries that peaked by 2010 grew to 49, representing 36 percent of global emissions (based on 2010 emissions data). This includes several more European countries such as <span data-country="austria" class="highlight">Austria</span>, <span data-country="iceland" class="highlight">Iceland</span>, <span data-country="ireland" class="highlight">Ireland</span>, <span data-country="spain" class="highlight">Spain</span> and <span data-country="portugal" class="highlight">Portugal</span> as well as <span data-country="brazil" class="highlight">Brazil</span> (which peaked in 2004), <span data-country="australia" class="highlight">Australia</span> (which peaked in 2006) and the <span data-country="united-states" class="highlight">United States</span> and <span data-country="canada" class="highlight">Canada</span> (both of which peaked in 2007).</span></p>

          <h3 class="ternary-topic">Will Peak by 2020</h3>
          <p>53 countries representing 40 percent of global emissions (based on 2010 emissions data rather than 2020 projections) peaked or have a commitment to peak by 2020. Countries with commitments to peak as part of their Copenhagen Accord pledges for 2020 include <span data-country="japan" class="highlight">Japan</span>, the <span data-country="republic-of-korea" class="highlight">Republic of Korea</span>, <span data-country="malta" class="highlight">Malta</span>, and <span data-country="new-zealand" class="highlight">New Zealand</span>. By 2020, almost all developed countries are expected to have peaked. 42 of the 43 Annex I countries under the UNFCCC are expected to peak—all except for Turkey (not shown).</p>

This brings the number of countries that have peaked or have a commitment to peak by 2030 to 57, representing 60 percent of global emissions (based on 2010 emissions data rather than 2030 projections).</span></p>

          <p>While this trend is encouraging, it’s not enough. Research suggests that to have a likely chance of staying within the 2°C limit for the least cost, global GHG emissions need to peak by 2020 at the latest. The world’s ability to limit warming to 1.5 or 2˚C depends not only on the number of countries that have peaked over time, but also the global share of emissions represented by those countries; their emissions levels at peaking; the timing of peaking; and the rate of emissions reductions after peaking.</p>
